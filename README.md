Django Ajax Events
===============

Request, respond, and react to ajax data in a more uniform way.

See original ReST: https://github.com/jacobstr/djangoajaxevent/blob/master/docs/index.rst for now.

This project is a couple of years old now - it may no longer work with current
versions of Django. I'll verify that.
